#  LostLink - Lost and Found Service

## 📘 Overview

**LostLink** is a full-stack web application designed to help students and campus communities easily **report, track, and recover lost or found items**.
Users can post items with images, comment for quick communication, and receive real-time notifications when someone interacts with their posts.

---

## ⚙️ Backend Implementation

The backend is built using **Node.js**, **Express**, and **MongoDB**, with a focus on **security**, **scalability**, and **clarity**.
It features RESTful APIs, **JWT authentication**, **role-based authorization**, and **Cloudinary** integration for image handling.
Admins have additional privileges to manage users, posts, and maintain a safe environment.

## 🧩 Technology Stack

* **Node.js** – Backend runtime
* **Express.js** – Server framework
* **MongoDB + Mongoose** – Database & schema modeling
* **JWT Authentication** – Secure user sessions
* **Cloudinary** – Image storage & optimization

---

## 🔐 Authentication & Authorization

* JSON Web Token (**JWT**) based authentication
* **Protected routes** with middleware verification
* **Role-based access control** (`Admin` / `User`)
* Tokens are sent as **Bearer tokens** in the Authorization header

## 🧱 Database Models

* **User** – Stores profile details, post/comment counts, and profile picture info
* **Post** – Represents lost or found items, includes multiple images and metadata
* **Comment** – Linked to posts for communication between users
* **Notification** – Tracks new interactions (like comments) for each user

## 🧾 Notes for Postman Testing

* Always include your JWT in **Authorization → Bearer Token**.
* Example Header:

  ```
  Authorization: Bearer <your_token_here>
  ```
* Image uploads use **form-data**:

  * Key: `image` (for profile)
  * Key: `images` (for post images, max 3)
* Admin privileges are not available by default; they must be **manually set in the database** using:

  ```json
  {
    "isAdmin": true
  }
  ```
